Notice: these passthrough interceptors will be bundled in a separate bundle. The SW response BroadcastChannels will be answered inside of proxy middleware. These passthrough interceptors also require the Browser Ports Middleware to be included in the web proxy.
This notice will be replaced by proper documentation in https://aero.sh/docs

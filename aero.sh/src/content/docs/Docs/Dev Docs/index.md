# How to build aero

A lot of types in aero are autogenerated when you run any of these build scripts once. The same applies to AeroSandbox.

> Since these are production builds the bundles will be in `.../aeroSW/dist/prod/...`

```bash
npm --profile=aeroSW i
npm --profile=aeroSW run buildSW
npm --profile=AeroSandbox i
npm --profile=AeroSandbox run build
```
> ⚠️ FIXME: There are currently issues building aero with `pnpm`, so please refrain from using it at the moment

# How to live debug aero

1. Execute these commands

  ```bash
  # For live build (so that all of the builds are the latest whenever you edit them because of the watcher)
  npm --profile=aeroSW i
  npm --profile=aeroSW start
  # For the actual demo site
  npm --profile=aero.sh i
  npm --profile=aero.sh start
  ```

> This will yield you an instance of the *aero.sh* site locally, and it will auto-update

> Run `git pull` and then run these commands again to update the dev server
> The port by default is **:2525**

## To debug the bundles

Run

```bash
npm run rsdoctor
```

> You should share those Rsdoctor ports if you are on a VSCode live share with collaborators

# How to build with your own feature flags

Modify `createDefaultFeatureFlags`

## With VSCode

In your editor: Press `f5` or `Menu -> Run -> Start Debugging`

## Notes

- You must run `pm2 restart <aero-build-watch/aero-sandbox-build-watch>` whenever you modify a compile-time Feature Flag for it to apply regardless if you are in a live build

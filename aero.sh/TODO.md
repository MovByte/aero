# TODOs

- [ ] Use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) whenever it should be used
- [ ] Start translations for `aero.sh`'s docs with [Tolgee](https://tolgee.io) support
- [ ] Use `ltex` to improve accuracy with GitHub Actions enabled to assist this

## Frontend

- [ ] Use [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com) and the [Catppuccin theme for it](https://github.com/midiidev/catppuccin-daisyui). The Catppuccin switcher that comes with Starlight will be hijacked for the switching.
- [ ] Make a top bar with links to these pages: about `index.astro`, proxy demo `proxy.astro`, playground/live demos `demos.astro`, stats `stats.astro`
- [ ] Find a React graphing library for the stats page
- [ ] Get data from GitHub CI builds for the stats page (usually in the form of CSV files) and visualize it
- [ ] Make Catppuccin theme switches that apply site-wide

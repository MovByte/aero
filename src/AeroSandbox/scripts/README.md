# AeroSandbox scripts

This directory contains CLI scripts that can also be used as a module and are run automatically during the build script for AeroSandbox. You should run these through `<npm/deno> run <SCRIPT_NAME>` after you have installed all of the dependencies. Some are chores, and others are required to generate the dist folder. It is important to note that `InitDist.ts` is also used in aero's build script as well.

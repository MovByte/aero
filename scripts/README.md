# aero scripts

This directory contains CLI scripts that can also be used as a module and are run automatically during the build script for aero. You should run these through `<npm/deno> run <SCRIPT_NAME>` after you have installed all of the dependencies. Some of these are chores, and others are required to generate the dist folder.
